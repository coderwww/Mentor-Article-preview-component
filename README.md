- [CSS Tips & Tricks #3 - CSS-only Tooltip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4lQwiUvGlY) - This helped me to create tooltip. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [drop-shadow()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow) - This helped me to create tooltip shadow. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
